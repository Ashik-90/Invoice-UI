# Invoice Generator UI on Excalidraw

Welcome to the Invoice Generator wireframe project! This project leverages Excalidraw, an open-source tool for creating interactive diagrams, to design a user interface for generating invoices. Excalidraw allows for intuitive and collaborative diagramming, making it a great choice for designing our invoice generator.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - No installation needed; it's a web-based tool.
- Basic knowledge of using Excalidraw for creating diagrams and UI elements.

### Installation

Since this project is designed using Excalidraw, there is no traditional installation process. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
2. Import or create the invoice generator UI diagram using Excalidraw’s tools.

### Usage

1. **Design the Invoice Layout:**
   - Use Excalidraw’s drawing tools to create the layout for your invoice.
   - Define sections for client information, items, totals, and any other required fields.

2. **Customize the UI:**
   - Adjust the design elements to match your preferred style and branding.
   - Collaborate with team members to finalize the design.

3. **Export the Design:**
   - Once the design is complete, you can export it as an image or share it directly from Excalidraw.
   - For generating actual invoices, you’ll need to implement the design in a web application or a PDF generation tool based on this UI layout.
